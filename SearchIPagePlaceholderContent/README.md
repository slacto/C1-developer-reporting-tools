Do yo ask yourself questions like these:
 - Which pages contains a table?
 - Which pages contains the class "read-more"?
 - Which pages contains style attributes?
Use this tool to search placeholder content HTML.

C1 4.0 required

TODO
This should not just search in IPagePlaceholder content but in all placeholder content. Custom placeholders should be defined in a .config file - please fix it if you can.

It would be nice if a click on a search result gave you the same options as when you browse a page (like locating the page in the tree and editing it).

It is currently not possible to search for "<h1>" - some of the characters are "unsafe".
