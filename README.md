# C1-developer-reporting-tools
Tools to help developers get a better overview of websites based on C1 CMS

Just copy the tools you want to use to your website. Use the same folder structure as used in the different tools.
The tools will typically contain one or more razor files (in /Composite/Developers) and a TreeDefinition (in \App_Data\Composite\TreeDefinitions)
The tools will appear in a new perspective in the C1 console called "Developer tools". Remember to give yourself access to this perspective.
